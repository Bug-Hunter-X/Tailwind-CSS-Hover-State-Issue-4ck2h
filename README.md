# Tailwind CSS Hover State Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to hover states in Tailwind CSS.  The issue involves a hover class not consistently applying, causing unexpected styling behaviors.  The bug is demonstrated in `bug.js`, and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Bug Description

A button element is styled using Tailwind CSS classes. The expected behavior is that the button's background color changes on hover, but this behavior is not consistently applied.  The problem might stem from conflicting CSS rules, incorrect class usage, or issues with how Tailwind processes the styles.

## Solution

The solution addresses the root cause, ensuring the hover state is correctly applied and overrides any conflicting styles.  See `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code and a detailed explanation.
